OMERO.tagsearch
================
OMERO.tagsearch is a plugin for `OMERO.web <https://github.com/ome/omero-web>`_ that enables searching of data using tags, with the search continuously refined as available search terms are entered and further term suggestions based on the entered terms are offered. 
This can be used in a way that is similar to navigating a file system hierarchy.

This was formerly part of `OMERO.webtagging <https://github.com/German-BioImaging/webtagging>`_, the umbrella name for tools developed to enhance use of text annotations (tags) in OMERO.

Requirements
============

As Python 2 has now reached end-of-life, OMERO 5.6 now
requires Python 3. With release 3.1.0 of tagsearch, the following are now required. To use tagsearch on older OMERO systems (running Python 2),
please use versions older than 3.1.0.

* Python 3.5 or later
* omero-web 5.6 or later
* django 1.11 or later

Installation
============

The recommended way to install tagsearch is using `pip`, but it is also possible
to install it manually as described `here <https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/omero5/developers/Web/CreateApp.html#add-your-app-location-to-your-pythonpath>`_.

::

  # In the python environment of OMERO.web (virtualenv or global)
  pip install omero-webtagging-tagsearch

  # Add tagsearch to webclient
  omero config append omero.web.apps '"omero_webtagging_tagsearch"'

  # Add a top-link to tagsearch designer
  omero config append omero.web.ui.top_links '["Tag Search", "tagsearch"]'


Documentation
=============

Available on the `OMERO website <http://help.openmicroscopy.org/web-tagging.html>`_.


Development
===========

Pure javascript so does not require a node build step.

To install using pip in development mode (in appropriate virtualenv)

::
  # In the top-level tagsearch directory containing setup.py
  pip install -e .
  cd $OMERO_PREFIX

OMERO development server can then be started in the usual way. Remember to
configure the tagsearch settings the same as above.

Project Maintenance
===================

I (Douglas) am no longer actively developing
OMERO.webtagging. I am thrilled to hand over
maintainence and development to
`German Bioimaging <https://gerbi-gmb.de/i3dbio/i3dbio-about/>`_.
